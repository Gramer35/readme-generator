# README GENERATOR

## Description

This project is to allow the user to create a professional README for their own projects. README's have typical templates so we are able to allow the user to answer a series of questions that will in turn populate a README created just for them!

## Usage

User will right click over the 'index.js' and open the Integrated Terminal. From there they will need to install inquirer by entering 'npm i' into the terminal. Once this has finished installing, the user will then enter 'node index.js' and the series of questions will then present themselves!
